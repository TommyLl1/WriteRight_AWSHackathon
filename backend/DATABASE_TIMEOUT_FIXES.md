# Database Timeout Handling Improvements

## Problem
The PostgreSQL database service was hanging during API requests, specifically at the pool status check in the `_get_pool()` method. This was causing API requests to never complete.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Pool Status Checking**: The `pool.get_size()` and `pool.get_idle_size()` calls could hang indefinitely if the pool was in a bad state.

2. **Connection Acquisition**: The `pool.acquire()` method could hang if all connections were stuck or if there were network issues.

3. **No Global Timeout Protection**: Database operations lacked comprehensive timeout protection.

4. **Pool Recreation Issues**: When the pool became unhealthy, the recreation process could also hang.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Timeout Protection

- **Added `_execute_with_timeout()` method**: Wraps database operations with timeout protection using `asyncio.wait_for()`
- **Added `_acquire_connection_with_timeout()` method**: Protects connection acquisition with timeouts
- **Applied timeouts to all major operations**: Insert, fetch, filter, etc.

### 2. Pool Health Management

- **Added `health_check()` method**: Performs quick health checks on the pool with timeouts
- **Added `ensure_healthy_pool()` method**: Ensures the pool is healthy before operations, recreating if necessary
- **Improved `_get_pool()` method**: Uses the new health check system instead of potentially hanging status checks

### 3. Better Connection Pool Configuration

- **Reduced connection lifecycle**: Shortened `max_inactive_connection_lifetime` from 10 minutes to 5 minutes
- **Added retry configuration**: Enabled `retry_on_failure` for better resilience
- **Improved error handling**: Better exception handling during pool creation

### 4. Enhanced Error Recovery

- **Force termination**: Uses `pool.terminate()` instead of `pool.close()` when timeouts occur
- **Graceful degradation**: Operations continue even if pool status checks fail
- **Better logging**: Enhanced debugging information for timeout and connection issues

### 5. Connection Management

- **Manual connection management**: Some operations now manually acquire/release connections with proper error handling
- **Better cleanup**: Ensures connections are properly released even if operations fail

## Key Changes Made

### In `pgdb.py`:

1. **New Methods Added**:
   - `_execute_with_timeout()`: Generic timeout wrapper
   - `_acquire_connection_with_timeout()`: Connection acquisition with timeout
   - `health_check()`: Quick database connectivity test
   - `ensure_healthy_pool()`: Pool health management

2. **Modified Methods**:
   - `_get_pool()`: Now uses health check system instead of potentially hanging operations
   - `insert_data()`: Split into public method with timeout and private implementation
   - `fetch_data()`: Split into public method with timeout and private implementation
   - `filter_data()`: Refactored to use timeout wrapper
   - `connect()`: Improved error handling and configuration

3. **Configuration Changes**:
   - Reduced `max_inactive_connection_lifetime` to 5 minutes
   - Added `retry_on_failure=True`
   - Adjusted connection pool settings for better stability

## Benefits

1. **No More Hanging**: API requests will timeout after 30 seconds instead of hanging indefinitely
2. **Better Diagnostics**: Enhanced logging helps identify connection issues
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Pool is automatically recreated when it becomes unhealthy
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Operations continue even if some pool monitoring fails
5. **Improved Reliability**: Better error handling and connection management

## Testing

A test script `test_db_timeout.py` was created to verify the timeout handling works correctly. The script tests:
- Database connection establishment
- Health check functionality
- Proper cleanup

## Deployment Notes

1. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for timeout warnings in the logs - they indicate when the system is recovering from connection issues
2. **Connection Monitoring**: The pool status is still logged but won't block operations
3. **Timeout Adjustments**: If 30-second timeouts are too short for your operations, adjust the timeout values in the methods
4. **Health Checks**: The health check runs automatically but can be called manually if needed

## Recommended Follow-up Actions

1. **Monitor Production**: Watch for timeout logs and pool recreation events
2. **Performance Testing**: Test with high concurrent load to ensure the changes work under stress
3. **Timeout Tuning**: Adjust timeout values based on your specific use case and network conditions
4. **Database Monitoring**: Monitor PostgreSQL logs for connection-related issues
